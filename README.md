Learning to program is a commonly sought after and highly valued skill in today’s world, but you may wonder how one goes about *learning* this skill? This guide wont teach you specifically how to implement the exact type of program you may want, but it is intended to help guide you on your search for that knowledge. To know what it is you don’t know is always a good starting point.

The first thing you need to do before you start writing programs is to choose the language you want to learn. This can be difficult as the number of programming languages that people use is constantly growing and evolving, but the same fundamental concepts apply to how you go about learning them. First you should ask yourself what kind of programs you want to write? Depending on what you want to make you may find high level or low level programming to be more useful.

What is High level programming? High level programming does not refer to the programmer’s skill here. In fact, low level languages are usually thought of as being harder. Programming level refers to how far removed a programming language is from machine language. Machine language is the language that computer hardware actually uses in order to run programs. Machine language in its raw state is very difficult for humans to write and understand. This is why programing languages were created. High level languages are *abstracted* in order to be faster for humans to write and easier for them to understand, while low level languages are more closely related to machine language. In order for languages of higher levels than machine language to be run, they have to first be translated into lower level languages. This process is usually handled automatically by a compiler. A programming language is really just a way to format text in order for it to be translated for a computer. 
	
<high Level languages>
High level languages allow for large programs to be written faster and also make them easier to manage when they are being worked on by multiple people. The overwhelming bulk of large web applications and mobile apps are written in these languages. Low level languages still have their uses though as high level languages often come with their own built in limitations and can sometimes become cumbersome to use due to their overwhelmingly large libraries that have to be understood and referenced in order to be used. As a result of being far removed from machine language, high level languages have to go through many layers in order to be run by the computer’s operating system. This usually makes programs written in a high level run slower. As a result of being further removed from machine language, high level languages can be more arbitrary when it comes to their design. Some examples of high level languages would be C#, Python and JavaScript. These types of programs are commonly used to make very large web and business applications that are used around the world.  

<low Level Languages> 
The lowest level programming languages created by humans are assembly languages, which are different depending on hardware. The next level up from this would be C language. Today these languages are mainly used to create operating systems and games. The list of programing languages that are commonly used is long and always changing, but you can always find out about more languages by googling them.

<Which level of programming is better?>
All programing levels have their uses. Paint Brushes are a good analogy to this. High level languages are like giant paint brushes that can quickly fill in shapes that are extremely large. Low level languages are like very small paint brushes that can be used to make very fine details. Using a large paint brush to paint tiny details would be very clunky, and trying to paint a whole room with a tiny paintbrush would take ridiculously long. So you should choose a language that best suits your needs. You can search for what programming languages are commonly used in the fields you are interested in. 

<writing your first program>
Once you have chosen a language that suites your needs it is time to try and write your first program. In order to do so technically all you need is a text editor and a compiler that understands your language, but if you are interested in high level languages or if you are a beginner you will probably want to use an Integrated Developer Environment, or IDE.

IDEs are special programs that are designed to make writing code for certain languages easier. This includes highlighting keywords and automatically detecting variable names and classes in order to autofill them when you are typing. IDEs will also be able to highlight errors in your code that would have made it impossible for your compiler to translate it. IDEs often come bundled with compilers, but these are often buried within large menus and project management systems. This makes setting up certain IDEs difficult, so it is recommended that you search for tutorials that show you how to access and run the compiler for your particular IDE. 
	<Hello World!>
For the first time writing a program it’s a very good idea to write a simple one in order to learn the basics of how to use your compiler and to see if it is working. These programs are often titled “Hello World” programs and typically implement a simple print statement that outputs text to a console or command line. Programming languages all have a different format for doing this, so you should look for tutorials or documentation for the one you are using. Print statements are commonly used for debugging, which is something you will need to do a lot when you are starting out. Some IDEs also come with a hello world template, which will set this program up for you. You can use this feature to get started but it wont necessarily teach you how to set up programs on your own. I recommend playing around with these and seeing what the IDE’s error messages say when you try changing things. 

<using the executable>

When you successfully run your compiler you should end up with an executable file somewhere on your computer, usually with the extension .exe. Where this file will appear depends on your IDE and compiler. If you are not using an IDE it will probably be located in the same folder as the file you compiled. If the file doesn’t appear it means there was a *compile error*. IDEs usually will output a message detailing the line of code this occurred on as well as some information on the cause of the error inside a running console. If you are not using an IDE you can sometimes find this information by running your compiler through your computer’s *command line*. In order to run a program from the command line you need to specify the location of the file on your computer with the name of the file attached to the end. You can access the location of your file by looking in the file properties. Once you have your executable file you can run it through the command line and see your message printed on the screen. You can also run your program using your IDE but I strongly recommend using the command line at least once in order to see that your applications can run independently. 

<how to learn the rest>
When you finally see your message printed you should congratulate yourself because getting your program to compile and run is often one of the toughest parts of writing a program. Once you learn this step learning to use the rest of your language is pretty much just looking up and following your language’s documentation. You can search for documentation or tutorials for your language online or you can purchase a book that teaches it. You would be surprised at how many good tutorials are out there especially if your language is commonly used. Some good things to learn first are how your language implements functions, if statements, and loops. Variable assignment is also a necessity. Learn how your language performs operations on variables as well as the different variable types. From here on out the things you need to learn will become more application specific. You can learn these things from taking free online courses or by finding a good tutorial series for the application type you want to build. The more you learn the more complex your programs can become, and the faster you will be able to write them. 
	
No amount of reading or listening can substitute actually spending time writing and compiling programs for yourself, so try to apply everything you learn about as you are learning about it. If you follow this philosophy you will be well on your way to building the applications that you want and becoming a seasoned programmer. Many experienced programmers were originally self-taught! And all programmers need to be able to find out information about their language for themselves. It is impossible to teach everything there is to know about a programming language. You have to learn to learn for yourself.
